Write a decorator, called log_func, that logs all calls to functions
that it decorates.

Please refer to the example from the lesson, in examples/memoize1.py.

Usage:

    @log_func
    def myfunc(a, b):
        print "Inside myfunc"
        return a * b

Behavior:

>>> Entering myfunc(3, 4) [call count: 1]
Inside myfunc
<<< Exiting myfunc(3, 4) => 12

>>> Entering myfunc(5, 6) [call count: 2]
Inside myfunc
<<< Exiting myfunc(5, 6) => 30
